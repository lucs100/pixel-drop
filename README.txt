A simple physics-based game created in Solar2D.

Line up the pegs, position the ball, and tap it to drop! If the ball activates every peg by hitting it at least once, then touches the goal, you complete the level and score points. However, if you leave a peg untouched, collide with a wall, or miss the goal, you'll fail the level and have to retry. Complete levels in as few tries as possible to achieve the highest scores!
